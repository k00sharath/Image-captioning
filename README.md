# Image-captioning
This is a deep learning model used to predict the captions for images.
In this model Inception_v3 and lstm network is used in combination 
the input for the inception _v3 model is  a image of size(299,299) and 
the input for the LSTM network is a caption of the image from the Training set
and the outputs of these networks are fed in to a neural network 
to predict the probabilities of next occuring word in a caption
The dataset used is flickr_8k
